## ðŸ§  ULM â€” Unified Learning Model

**ULM (Unified Learning Model)** is an open-source framework designed to unify multiple machine learning paradigms â€” supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and transfer learning â€” into a single, flexible architecture.

---

### ðŸš€ Key Features

* **Unified Framework:** Combine various learning approaches under one model.
* **Modular Architecture:** Plug-and-play components for different ML tasks.
* **Cross-Domain Learning:** Train once, adapt across datasets and domains.
* **Scalable Training:** Built to handle distributed and large-scale training.
* **Extensible:** Easy to integrate with PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX backends.

### ðŸ§© Architecture Overview

ULM is composed of the following core modules:

| Module                     | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Engine**            | Manages data flow, training loops, and model orchestration. |
| **Adapters**               | Interface layers that connect different learning paradigms. |
| **Knowledge Fusion Layer** | Combines representations across tasks or domains.           |
| **Optimizer Hub**          | Houses various optimizers, schedulers, and meta-learners.   |
| **Evaluation Suite**       | Provides metrics and visualization tools.                   |
